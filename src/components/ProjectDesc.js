          The purpose of this fully functional application is to serve as a
          clone of YouTube. This project tests our coding skills and our
          understanding of JavaScript and React. Users are able to search up a
          keyword and the results will display a list of videos related to that
          keyword, just like YouTube.
        </h3>
