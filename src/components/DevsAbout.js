            Hello world! My name is Salina and I am a student at Pursuit
            studying to become a fullstack web developer that positively impacts
            the world! As someone who enjoys volunteering and helping others, I
            hope to use the skills and knowledge obtained through Pursuit to
            develop applications that assist people with the means to improve
            their health, lifestyle, and quality of life with my shift into
            tech.
