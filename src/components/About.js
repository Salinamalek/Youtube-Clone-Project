            The purpose of this fully functional application is to serve as a
            clone of YouTube. This project tests our coding skills and our
            understanding of JavaScript and React. Users are able to search up a
            keyword and the results will display a list of videos related to
            that keyword, just like YouTube.

            Hello world! My name is Salina and I am a student at Pursuit
            studying to become a fullstack web developer that positively impacts
            the world! As someone who enjoys volunteering and helping others, I

            develop applications that assist people with the means to improve
            their health, lifestyle, and quality of life with my shift into
            tech.
